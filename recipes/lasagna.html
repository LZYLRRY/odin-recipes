        <h2>Description</h2>

        <p>Lasagna is a classic Italian dish that features layers of pasta sheets alternated with rich fillings,
            typically including a savory mixture of ground meat, tomato sauce, and creamy béchamel or ricotta cheese.
            Each layer is carefully assembled, allowing the flavors to meld together as the dish bakes in the oven,
            resulting in a comforting, hearty meal. The top is usually sprinkled with a generous amount of melted
            mozzarella and Parmesan cheese, which forms a golden, bubbly crust.</p>

        <p>This dish is renowned for its versatility, with variations ranging from the traditional meat-based version to
            vegetarian options featuring ingredients like spinach, zucchini, or mushrooms. Lasagna is often seasoned
            with a blend of Italian herbs such as basil, oregano, and garlic, adding depth to its flavor profile.
            Whether served at a casual family dinner or a special occasion, lasagna is a crowd-pleaser that embodies the
            warmth and richness of Italian cuisine.</p>
