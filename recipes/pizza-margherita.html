        <h2>Desciption</h2>

        <p>
            Pizza Margherita is a quintessential Italian dish that embodies the beauty of simplicity in culinary art. This traditional pizza features a thin, airy crust that serves as the perfect canvas for a few select ingredients. The base is a vibrant tomato sauce made from ripe, sweet tomatoes, which provides a tangy and fresh contrast to the creamy slices of fresh mozzarella cheese. As the pizza bakes, the cheese melts into the sauce, creating a delightful harmony of textures and flavors. Fresh basil leaves are scattered on top, adding a fragrant, herbal note that complements the rich and savory elements of the dish.

            The origins of Pizza Margherita are steeped in Italian history, with the pizza being named after Queen Margherita of Italy in the late 19th century. The combination of red tomatoes, white mozzarella, and green basil is said to represent the colors of the Italian flag, making this pizza not only a culinary delight but also a symbol of national pride. Drizzled with a bit of olive oil before serving, Pizza Margherita is a masterpiece of balance, where each ingredient shines through, offering a taste of Italy in every bite. Its elegance and straightforward preparation make it a beloved favorite, enjoyed by pizza enthusiasts worldwide.

                <h3>Prepare the Dough:</h3>
            </li>

            <ul>
                <li>In a small bowl, dissolve 1 tsp sugar in 1 1/2 cups warm water.</li>
                <li>Sprinkle the active dry yeast over the water and let it sit for about 5-10 minutes until foamy.</li>

                <li>Mix until the dough comes together, then knead on a lightly floured surface for about 8-10 minutes, adding more flour as needed, until smooth and elastic.</li>
                <li>Place the dough in a lightly oiled bowl, cover it with a damp cloth, and let it rise in a warm place for 1-2 hours, or until doubled in size.</li>
            </ul>

            <li>
                <h3>Prepare the Sauce:</h3>
            </li>

            <ul>
